# Catalogue of deep learning models 
Note: All models are archived on our AWS SE bucket ml-catalogue.
## The original model [published](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.2c00045)
1. 5 homogeneous mechanisms: E, EC, CE, ECE, DISP
2. ~5k training data for each mechanism
3. scan rates: linearly between 0.01 to 2 V/s
- See original paper model.zip
